# CharacterRecognition
Draw a character and the Neural Network will do its best to recognize it.

Run the ImageRecognition.py file and draw!
```python
python ImageRecognition.py
```

press 'r' to reset the image

Created with tensorflow/keras and pygame (so you might need those libraries to run it)
